	<h2>Infinity correction</h2>
	<p>
	An ideal infinity corrected objective can collect the emission from a point 
	particle at the specified \(NA\) (i.e. a portion of a <em>spherical</em> wave) 
	and produce a <em>plane</em> wave at the back aperture. So in other words, an 
	object plane (P<sub>o</sub> below) is 'sent' to an image plane (P<sub>i</sub> 
	below) at an infinite distance, which is a key property we can use to 
	determine how the lens operates (even if we don't know what's inside).

	a high \(NA\) microscope objective) must obey the <em>sine condition</em>:
	
	\[ y_i n_i \sin\gamma_i = y_o n_o \sin\gamma_o \tag{1}\]
	
	where \(y\) is the height of the point from the optic axis, \(\gamma\) is the 
	angle the marginal ray makes with the optic axis and \(n\) is the refractive 
	index of the medium (and subscripts 'o' and 'i' are for object and image

	(2019)">Born 2019</a>, if we now consider a pair of points on the optic axis 
	(p<sub>o0</sub> and p<sub>i0</sub>), and 'send' the image plane (P<sub>i</sub>) 
	very far to the left by a distance \(-d_i\) (i.e. towards \(-\infty\)) then 
	we can see that as the angle gets small \(\sin\gamma_i \to \gamma_i\), and 
	we can write:
	
	\[ \gamma_i = \lim_{d_i\to \infty} \left(\frac{h_i}{-d_i}\right) \tag{2}\]
	
	So in the limit of infinity corrected objectives, we can rewrite (1) as:
	
	\[ y_i n_i \left(\frac{h_i}{-d_i}\right) = y_o n_o \sin\gamma_o \tag{3}\]
	
	From the paraxial solutions to geometrical optics, (now valid on the left
	since \(\sin\gamma_i \to \gamma_i\)) we can use the relations for the lateral
	magnification \(M_T\):
	
	\[ M_T = \frac{y_i}{y_o} = -\frac{d_i}{f_i} \tag{4}\]
	
	Combining (3) and (4) simplifies to:
	
	\[ n_i \left(\frac{h_i}{f_i}\right) = n_o \sin\gamma_o \tag{5}\]
	
	Since the image is normally formed in air (\(n_i=1\)), we can set
	\(\gamma_0 = \theta\) and drop the subscripts to write:
	
	\[ h = f n \sin\theta \tag{6}\]

	which produces the familiar equation for the diameter of the back focal 
	plane \(D_{BFP}\)

	\[ D_{BFP} = 2 f NA \tag{7}\]
	
	<strong>Note:</strong> equation (6) has important implications for how we 
	<em>use</em> an infinity corrected objective. The 'rays' from the object 
	map to the exit pupil according to \(\sin\theta\), so the pupil is not a 
	plane, but a <strong>spherical cap</strong>:
