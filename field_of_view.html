	<h2>Field of view</h2>
	<p>
	The field of view (\(FOV\)) of an objective is rarely specified, perhaps because
	the definition is not standardised. For example, one could say that the \(FOV\) 
	is the range over which the image is diffraction limited at the maximum \(NA\) 
	(a stringent definition giving the smallest fields, but arguably the most correct
	choice). Alternatively one could accept the field over which stigmatic imaging 
	is maintained for some fraction of the maximum \(NA\) (for example 80%). In 
	reality, without full design information for the objective and tube lens, 
	<strong>we simply don't know the field of view</strong>. It is common 
	to <em>estimate</em> the \(FOV\) using the tube lens field number \(FN\) and 
	objective magnification \(M_T\):
	
	\[ FOV \sim \frac{FN}{M_T} \tag{1}\]
