		<h2>Back focal plane</h2>
		<p>
		The back focal plane (BFP) is an important design and build parameter 
		that may affect, for example, the kind of tube lens that is used with 
		the objective to form a finite image. It is also common to image the 
		BFP onto other optics like scanning mirrors or adaptive optics etc, and
		so knowing the size of the BFP may be important. Fortunately, we know 
		from the infinity correction, that the BFP diameter (\(D_{BFP}\)) 
		scales with the focal length and numerical aperture of the objective 
		according to:
		
		\[ D_{BFP} = 2 f NA \tag{1}\]
		
		However it may also be useful to know the <em>location</em> of the BFP
		for mechanical and alignment considerations, for example how far the BFP
		is from the objective flange. Not all manufacturers provide this 
		information, so it may be down to the builder to find out for themselves.
		In practice the BFP is often located <em>inside</em> the objective, i.e.
		a focusing laser beam into the rear of the objective will produce an 
		output of minimal divergence when the focus is some distance past the 
		flange. Sometimes the only way to find out is to do this test and measure!
